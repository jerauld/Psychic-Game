# Psychic-Game

**Overview**

Psychic Game was created for the Psychic Game homework assignment for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript running in a browser. 

**Requirements**

- Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.
- Display the following on the page:
    - The phrase "Get what letter I'm thinking of"
    - Wins: (# of times of user guessed the word correctly).
    - Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
    - Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
    - When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
    - When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).

**Note: I chose not to style the game too much because of the need to put more effort in the more challenging and recommended Word Guess Game**
